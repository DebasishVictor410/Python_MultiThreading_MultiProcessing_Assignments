    "#### Multiprocessing\n",
    "#### The system can execute numerous processes at once is called multiprocessing\n",
    "#### It is a built-in multiprocessing library. \n",
    "#### It will make it possible to divide apps into smaller, independent threads. \n",
    "#### The operating system can then assign each of these threads or processes to a processor or several processors\n",
    "#### So they can execute concurrently, enhancing performance and effectiveness overall.\n",
    "#### The main purpose of MultiProcessing is to utilize the CPU properly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Its importance\n",
    "#### It becomes difficult to perform several processes on a single processor. \n",
    "#### To keep up with the growing number of processes, the processor will have to pause the current one and switch to the next.\n",
    "#### As a result, it will have to stop each activity, which will lower performance.\n",
    "#### If we use use multiprocessing we can divide our tasks to different processors\n",
    "#### Suppose, I have to do my home-cleanning work, cooking works, office works at once at the same time\n",
    "#### Then if i want to do that at the same time then i must stop for some time then swith to another task and this process will go on\n",
    "#### But instead of this if there are extra two person for doing other two works the it would be be easy\n",
    "#### We can utilize the time efficiently\n",
    "#### The parallelly do multiple works at a time\n",
    "#### So for this MultiProcessing is very important"
